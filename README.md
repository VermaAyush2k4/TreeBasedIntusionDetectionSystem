# TreeBasedIntusionDetectionSystem
# Overview:
Tree based IDS has use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a promising technology in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to improve safety and driving efficiency. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology enables communication among vehicles and other infrastructures. However, AVs and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) are vulnerable to different types of cyber-attacks such as denial of service, spoofing, and sniffing attacks. An intelligent IDS is proposed in this paper for network attack detection that can be applied to not only Controller Area Network (CAN) bus of AVs but also on general IoVs. The proposed IDS utilizes tree-based ML algorithms including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extra trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results from the implementation of the proposed intrusion detection system on standard data sets indicate that the system has the ability to identify various cyber-attacks in the AV networks. Furthermore, the proposed ensemble learning and feature selection approaches enable the proposed system to achieve high detection rate and low computational cost simultaneously.
